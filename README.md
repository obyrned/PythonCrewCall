# CrewCalc
A simple Python script that can read a CSV of fictitious list of flight attendant names and recommend who to activate based on days left on call and reverse seniority.

If you don't want to worry about a virtual environment or modules, you can pull the Docker image 'obyrned/python-crew-callout'
